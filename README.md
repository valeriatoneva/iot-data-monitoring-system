Starting an IoT data monitoring system involves several stages, including setting up your development environment, initializing the backend services, preparing the frontend, and ensuring all components communicate effectively. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. Environment Setup
Install docker and MongoDB and make sure it's running as your backend services will need to connect to it.
Clone the repository to your local machine if you haven't already.
2. Backend Services
Navigate to the backend directory in your terminal.

Set up environment variables. Create a .env file in your backend service root directory and define necessary variables such as:

MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/sensorDB
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=3000

Each service (alerting-service and data-ingestion-service) has its own app.js file. You'll need to navigate into the directory of the service you want to start and run the npm start command from there.

- cd data-ingestion-service
- npm install
- npm start



3. Frontend Services
Navigate to the frontend directory in your terminal.
Install dependencies for the frontend services using npm or Yarn.
sh
Copy code
npm install
or
sh
Copy code
yarn install
Make sure the frontend is set up to communicate with the backend API at the correct URL and port.
Start the frontend development server. Most frontend setups have a command similar to:
sh
Copy code
npm run start
or
sh
Copy code
yarn start
The frontend should now be accessible in your web browser, usually at http://localhost:3000 or another port specified in the frontend configuration.
4. Testing End-to-End
With both the frontend and backend running, perform an end-to-end test to make sure they are integrated properly.
Try out the full flow from the frontend: signing up a user, logging in, sending sensor data through the API, and verifying that the data is correctly displayed and stored.
5. Docker Setup
Since you have a docker-compose.yml file, make sure it is configured correctly with the services, networks, and volumes.
Use Docker Compose to build and run your containers:
sh
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
This command will build the Docker images for your services and start them up.
6. Monitoring and Debugging
Monitor your application's logs for any errors or issues.
If there are errors, debug them by checking the stack trace, logs, and reviewing your code.
7. Continuous Development
As you develop new features or make changes, repeat the testing process to ensure stability.
Implement additional tooling as needed for automated testing, CI/CD, linting, and code formatting.
8. Deployment
Once you're confident in the stability of your application, you can prepare for deployment to a production environment.
Consider using services like AWS, GCP, Azure, or Heroku for hosting your application.
Remember that setting up a system like this can be complex and may require troubleshooting various issues along the way. If you encounter specific errors or have questions about certain steps, feel free to ask for more detailed help.
